## Here you can easily compare the power estimates
## made on the basis of your simulations

On this page you can see a curtailed version of the results from the two previous simulation pages.  
It is meant to help you compare the power estimates. The conclusion is for you to throw, as the values  
below will change depending on what specification of the simulations you have chosen on the previous pages.  

However, a good rule of thumb is to first read the real power estimate, and then see whether it is included   
in the confidence intervals provided by either technique. Remember to use the "Estimated Discovery Rate"  
(EDR) in the case of z-curve. Bear in mind that the higher the number of samples, the more precise the   
estimate of the real power.
